    "### Defining data as constants\n",

    "After you have imported constant, you will use it to transform a numpy array, credit_numpy, into a tensorflow constant, credit_constant. This array contains feature columns from a dataset on credit card holders and is previewed in the image below. We will return to this dataset in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
