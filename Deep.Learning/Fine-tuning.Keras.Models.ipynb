    "### Changing optimization parameters\n",
    "It's time to get your hands dirty with optimization. You'll now try optimizing a model at a very low learning rate, a very high learning rate, and a \"just right\" learning rate. You'll want to look at the results after running this exercise, remembering that a low value for the loss function is good.    \n",
    "For these exercises, we've pre-loaded the predictors and target values from your previous classification models (predicting who would survive on the Titanic). You'll want the optimization to start from scratch every time you change the learning rate, to give a fair comparison of how each learning rate did in your results. So we have created a function get_new_model() that creates an unoptimized model to optimize.   \n",
