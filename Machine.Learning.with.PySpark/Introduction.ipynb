    "### Creating a SparkSession\n",

    "\n",
    "The SparkSession class has a builder attribute, which is an instance of the Builder class. The Builder class exposes three important methods that let you:\n",
    "\n",
    "specify the location of the master node;  \n",
    "name the application (optional); and  \n",
    "retrieve an existing SparkSession or, if there is none, create a new one.  \n",
    "The SparkSession class has a version attribute which gives the version of Spark.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Find out more about SparkSession here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are finished with the cluster, it's a good idea to shut it down, which will free up its resources, making them available for other processes.\n",
